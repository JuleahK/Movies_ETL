# Movies_ETL

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help the company, Amazing Prime, create a database and keep it updated on a daily basis. Data from three sources, Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens, was refactored and loaded in a single PostgreSQL database.

**Note, the metadata and ratings files were too large to upload to github.
